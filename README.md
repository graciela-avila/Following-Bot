# Following-Bot
This is my CSE 400 project where I make a following robot that "speak" Dante's words from his Commedia while it follows someone. 
The code runs four motors on a chassis system on a raspberry pi 4. 
This code uses distance information received through an ultrasonic sensor through an arduino uno connected to the raspberry pi 4.
