# Following-Bot
Creating a small bot that follows people around and is annoying like Dante following around Virgil in Dante's Commedia.
## 1. Introduction
This is my CSE 400 project where I make a following robot that "speak" Dante's words from his Commedia while it follows someone. The code runs four motors on a chassis system on a raspberry pi 4. This code uses distance information received through an ultrasonic sensor through an arduino uno connected to the raspberry pi 4.
## 2. Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- Arduino Uno
- Webcam
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
- 2x L298N DC Motor Controller
- 4x DC Motors
## 3. Software Used
- OpenCV Color Detection through raspberry pi 4
- arduino ide for distance calculations 
- motor control through raspberry pi 4
